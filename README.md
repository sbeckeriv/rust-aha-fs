# rust-aha-fs
using netfuse (rust-fuse wrapper) to interface with aha.io

Using the same configs as my other aha apps. 

Running mounts /tmp/ahafs (need to make sure the dir is there already)

after removing  `fusermount -u /tmp/ahafs`

data/projects/releases/(epics|features)/files (description body)

epics dont work. its a mess. read only access.
